## User Request

Run a comprehensive full review, dispatch agents to fix the surfaced issues, finish the remaining review phases, then quick-push the current checkout if no further issues remained.

## Session Overview

Completed a multi-phase review of the current Synapse diff, fixed the review findings, validated the fixes with targeted tests and live-safe Docker reads, bumped the project version to `0.5.1`, and prepared the work for push.

## Sequence of Events

1. Ran the comprehensive review workflow and wrote `.full-review/00-scope.md`, `.full-review/01-quality-architecture.md`, and `.full-review/02-security-performance.md`.
2. Dispatched one worker to fix Phase 1 and Phase 2 findings while another worker completed Phases 3 through 5.
3. Integrated the fixes: concurrent Docker daemon discovery, typed daemon IDs, parser/build/dedupe tests, and documentation clarification.
4. Dispatched two more workers for remaining review items: live-safe Docker validation and skill frontmatter cleanup.
5. Refreshed `.full-review/04-best-practices.md` and `.full-review/05-final-report.md` after all remediation and validation.
6. Bumped the project version from `0.5.0` to `0.5.1` and synced version-bearing metadata.

## Key Findings

- `target_docker_hosts()` originally performed serial daemon discovery before all-host fanout; this was changed to concurrent `fanout`.
- Docker daemon ID extraction was changed from JSON pointer access to typed `SystemInfo.id`.
- `flux container exec --command ...` now has explicit parser coverage for flag-looking argv after `--command`.
- Live-safe validation confirmed `local` is deduped when it points at the same Docker daemon as `dookie`.
- A short-TTL daemon-ID cache was considered and skipped because live evidence did not justify the added complexity.

## Technical Decisions

- Kept the current checkout on `main` because the user requested quick-push to the current local checkout.
- Used a patch version bump because the work is fixes, tests, docs, and review remediation.
- Did not add plugin manifest versions; repo instructions say plugin marketplace versions derive from git SHA.
- Did not run destructive smoke commands; the destructive route remains optional operator validation.

## Beads Activity

| bead | title | actions | final status | why |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `rmcp-template-4qb` | Comprehensive review current Synapse changes | created, claimed, updated, closed | closed | Tracked the full review workflow and artifacts |
| `rmcp-template-t2o` | Fix review phase 1-2 findings | created, claimed, closed | closed | Tracked remediation of Phase 1 and Phase 2 findings |
| `rmcp-template-018` | Address remaining full-review Rust performance items | created, claimed, closed | closed | Tracked live-safe validation and TTL-cache decision |
| `rmcp-template-sgo` | Address remaining full-review documentation items | created, claimed, closed | closed | Tracked skill metadata cleanup and artifact refresh |

## Repository Maintenance

- Plans: `docs/plans/` was queried by the save workflow context; no plan moves were performed in this quick-push session.
- Beads: all session beads listed above were closed after verification.
- Worktrees and branches: current worktree is `/home/jmagar/workspace/synapse2` on `main`; no stale worktree or branch cleanup was performed because the user asked to push the current checkout.
- Stale docs: `plugins/synapse2/skills/synapse2/SKILL.md`, `docs/CLI_DESTRUCTIVE_SMOKE.md`, and `.full-review/*` were updated where review findings proved them stale.

## Tools and Skills Used

- Shell commands: git status/diff, cargo tests/check/clippy, version sync checks, bead commands, live-safe Synapse CLI reads.
- File edits: `apply_patch` for code, docs, review artifacts, version metadata, and this session note.
- Skills: `comprehensive-full-review`, `superpowers:dispatching-parallel-agents`, `superpowers:receiving-code-review`, `vibin:quick-push`, `vibin:save-to-md`.
- Subagents: four workers handled code remediation, remaining review artifacts, live-safe validation, and docs cleanup.
- External CLIs: `bd`, `cargo`, `jq`, `/usr/bin/time`, and `target/debug/synapse`.

## Commands Executed

| command | result |
|---|---|
| `cargo test --test cli_parse` | passed |
| `cargo test flux_service::docker::tests` | passed |
| `cargo test flux_service::tests` | passed |
| `cargo clippy -- -D warnings` | passed |
| `cargo build --quiet` | passed |
| `target/debug/synapse flux docker info --response-format json` | passed; 6 daemon hosts, expected partial errors for Docker-unavailable hosts |
| `target/debug/synapse flux docker images --response-format json` | passed; 161 images across successful hosts |
| `target/debug/synapse flux container list --response-format json` | passed; 118 containers across successful hosts |
| `target/debug/synapse flux docker df --response-format json` | passed; slow because Docker disk usage is heavy |
| `cargo check` | passed as `synapse2 v0.5.1` |
| `scripts/check-version-sync.sh` | passed; all 3 version-bearing files at `0.5.1` |

## Errors Encountered

- The first broad review-artifact patch failed because one expected line did not match; split patches were applied successfully.
- An initial version grep returned historical `0.5.0` references plus active generated metadata; active files were synced to `0.5.1`, historical references were left alone.
- `target/debug/synapse2` was identified by a worker as stale during timing checks; live validation used `target/debug/synapse`.

## Behavior Changes

| area | before | after |
|---|---|---|
| Docker all-host reads | Daemon discovery risked serial preflight behavior | Daemon discovery uses concurrent `fanout` |
| Daemon ID extraction | JSON pointer into `docker info` value | Typed `SystemInfo.id` helper |
| Container exec CLI parsing | Flag-looking argv after `--command` could be parsed as Synapse args | Everything after `--command` is container argv |
| Docker build | Local subprocess path | Selected host `HostExec` path |
| Synapse skill metadata | Long frontmatter with operational instruction | Concise metadata plus body guidance |

## Verification Evidence

| command | expected | actual | status |
|---|---|---|---|
| `cargo test --test cli_parse` | parser tests pass | 15 passed | pass |
| `cargo test flux_service::docker::tests` | Docker helper tests pass | 28 passed | pass |
| `cargo test flux_service::tests` | Flux service tests pass | 5 passed | pass |
| `cargo clippy -- -D warnings` | no warnings | passed | pass |
| `scripts/check-version-sync.sh` | all current versions match | all 3 files at `0.5.1` | pass |
| live-safe Synapse Docker reads | read-only commands complete with expected partials | passed | pass |

## Risks and Rollback

- Destructive smoke commands were not run; `docs/CLI_DESTRUCTIVE_SMOKE.md` remains the optional operator route.
- `docker df` can be slow on the current inventory; rollback is to revert the commit if the dedupe/build changes regress live behavior.
- If repeated long-lived server calls show measurable daemon discovery overhead, add a short-TTL daemon-ID cache later.

## Decisions Not Taken

- Did not add a TTL daemon-ID cache because live all-host read evidence did not justify the complexity.
- Did not force-push or create a branch because the user asked for quick-push to the current checkout.
- Did not add plugin manifest versions because repo policy forbids them.

## References

- `.full-review/05-final-report.md`
- `docs/CLI_DESTRUCTIVE_SMOKE.md`
- `plugins/synapse2/skills/synapse2/SKILL.md`

## Next Steps

- Run the destructive smoke route only when an operator explicitly wants to validate mutating Docker/Compose commands.
- Monitor all-host read latency in the long-lived server process before adding a daemon-ID cache.
